Some of the prior dominant approaches to management were based on faulty views of human nature. Thus, they may have resulted in great efficiency, but at the expense of people.[2] Ultimately, of course, this also hindered productivity because when people are less engaged, they are less effective. But worse, these approaches were against the purpose of management, which is not simply to get things done through others, but to develop people in the accomplishment of tasks.
